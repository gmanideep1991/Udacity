You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1. Nothing new yet may be i will be learning more in coming projects. 

2. No project is easy. I think every project is different in unique way. For me atleast since i have previous experience i could easy find out which tags needs to be used.

3. Finding the right text size i think i made a good job figuring out. But ultimately you guys can know for sure.

4. Nothing yet.
